# Zero Dark Thirty

Zero Dark Thirty is a single place for interview preparation, well atleast a single
place to have all links and documents for preparation. It will have solutions
from different places for DSA, generic DSA problems and theory, notes in PDF for
reference, LLD, HLD materials related to PDF, probably some LLD projects and HLD
designs, CS basics notes.

As Kathyrn Bigelow explains, "it's a military term for early morning before dawn, 
and it refers also to the darkness and secrecy that cloaked the entire 
decade-long mission."

**NOTE**: This project is educational and preparation for interview for product
companies, solutions might be best, but imho computer science is opinions...So take
everything here with a pinch of salt.
